## ✨ Design Highlights

- 🎨 **Deep dark theme** — layered dark navy/black backgrounds with cyan, blue & violet accent system
- 💡 **Scroll progress bar** — gradient line tracking scroll position at the top of the page
- 🧭 **Smart sticky navbar** — frosted glass effect on scroll + active section auto-highlight + animated section label pill
- 🌀 **Scroll reveal animations** — fade-in + slide-up via IntersectionObserver with staggered delays
- 🔔 **Custom modal alert system** — replaces all browser `alert()` calls with a beautiful backdrop dialog
- 🍔 **Animated hamburger menu** — smooth X animation for mobile
- 📐 **CSS variables design system** — full token-based theming (colors, radius, transitions, shadows)
